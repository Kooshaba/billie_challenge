# What I would do if I had more time
### Page Design
 - Make the page responsive.
 - Make a page background and a UI component to hold the dog pictures.
 - Make a more obvious, animated loading state on the 'New Dog!' button.

### State Management
 - If other parts of the site start relying on the state here, I would use Redux to manage global state of the application rather than passing down state directly from the App component.

### Testing
 - Add fully functional tests to spin up a browser and go through the entire flow of the application

### Request Management
 - Use a debounce function to throttle requests to the dog API to prevent someone from spam clicking the 'New Dog!' button

### File Structure
 - Separate each component into a different JSX file for readability

Thank you for considering me! Have a nice day üòÅ
